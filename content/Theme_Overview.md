This site provides a demo for the After Dark theme for the 
[Gutenberg](https://www.getgutenberg.io/) static site generator.  After Dark
was designed by [Vincent Prouillet](https://vincent.is/) and was based on
the After Dark Hugo theme by Josh Habdas.  This demo site was built by
[Daniel Sockwell](www.codesections.com).  Both the theme and this site are
licensed under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), so
you may freely use and redistribute either for commercial or non-commercial

You can find the source code for this site [in its GitHub
repository](https://www.github.com) and can find the source code for the 
theme in the [After Dark](https://www.github.com/Keats/after-dark) repository.
