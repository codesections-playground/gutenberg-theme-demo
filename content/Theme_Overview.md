This site provides a demo for the Hyde theme for the 
[Gutenberg](https://www.getgutenberg.io/) static site generator.  Hyde
was designed by [Vincent Prouillet](https://vincent.is/) and was based on
the [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) Jekyll theme.  This demo site was
built by [Daniel Sockwell](https://www.codesections.com).  Both the theme and
this site are licensed under the
[MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), so you may freely use and
redistribute either for commercial or non-commercial work.

You can find the source code for this site [in its GitHub
repository](https://github.com/codesections/gutenberg-theme-demo/tree/hyde)
and can find the source code for the theme in the
[Hyde](https://www.github.com/Keats/hyde) repository.  For a
description of this theme and links to other Gutenberg themes, please

This theme has a few special configuration options that allow its color-scheme
and the position of the side bar to be configured.  Please see the repository
for details.
